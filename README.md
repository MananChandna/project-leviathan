                        <strong>Project Leviathan</strong> represents the genesis and central repository for a significant upcoming official project. It is not just a preliminary draft but the active, evolving foundation upon which the final product will be built.

                        This repository contains the core architecture, essential modules, and experimental features that are being developed, tested, and refined. All work committed here is directly intended for integration into the final, production-level application. It serves as the single source of truth for the project's development lifecycle.
